Guided Exploration No. 3 Snippets file.

Snippet 1
================================
# This imports the random library 
import random

Snippet 2
================================
# This is a empty list to store all the rap names from rap-name.txt
possible_names = []

Snippet 3
================================
# This open a new file and store all the new generated names from the code
outputFile = open('rap-names-output.txt', 'w')

Snippet 4
================================
# This is used to open read access then it assigns a handle to file datafile 
with open('rap-names.txt', 'r') as dataFile:
    # This is a for loop to iterate through the lines in rap-names.txt
    for name in dataFile:
        # This reads each a line and removes the invisible line feed at the end of each line, Then it appends to the possible names list
        possible_names.append(name.rstrip())

Snippet 5
================================
# This asks for how many rap names
count = int(input('How many rap names would you like to create? '))
# This asks for how many parts it contain
parts = int(input('How many parts should the name contain? '))

Snippet 6
================================
# This counted loop is used to generate the amount that was asked for
for i in range(count):
    # This is a empty list to hold the rap name parts
    name_parts = []
    # Another counted loop to iterate the number of rap names that was asked to be part of the names
    for j in range(parts):
        # This will append the names part to the list, there are two parameters to help generate a random number to get rap name from list 
        name_parts.append(possible_names[random.randint(0, len(possible_names)-1)])

Snippet 7
================================
# This writes out a name after it has been generated, also it takes the name parts list and glues them together with a space
outputFile.write(f"{' '.join(name_parts)}\n")
# This displays the output in the terminal
print(f"{' '.join(name_parts)}")

Snippet 8
================================
# This will close the output file
outputFile.close()
